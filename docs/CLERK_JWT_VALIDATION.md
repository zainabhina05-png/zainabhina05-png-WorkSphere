# Clerk Authentication & JWT Validation

This document explains how WorkSphere authenticates requests using [Clerk](https://clerk.com), how `src/middleware.ts` gates access to routes, and how server-side code verifies who's making a request. It reflects the current implementation in the repo (`src/middleware.ts`, `src/lib/auth.ts`, and the API routes under `src/app/api`).

## 1. JWT Verification Flow

Clerk issues a short-lived **session JWT** to the browser after sign-in and stores it in a `__session` cookie (plus a client-side copy Clerk's SDK manages for you). Every request from the browser to a WorkSphere page or API route automatically carries that cookie — there's no manual token attachment in `fetch` calls.

```
┌────────────┐        1. Sign in via Clerk        ┌────────────┐
│   Browser  │ ───────────────────────────────►   │   Clerk    │
│ (Next.js   │ ◄─────────────────────────────────  │  (hosted)  │
│  client)   │      2. Session JWT in cookie       └────────────┘
└─────┬──────┘
      │ 3. Request to /api/* or a page
      │    (cookie sent automatically)
      ▼
┌───────────────────────┐
│   src/middleware.ts    │  4. clerkMiddleware() intercepts
│  (Next.js Middleware)  │     the request before it reaches
└─────────┬──────────────┘     any route handler
          │ 5. Verifies JWT signature + expiry
          │    against Clerk's public keys
          ▼
┌───────────────────────┐
│   Route Handler /      │  6. auth() / currentUser() reads
│   Page Component       │     the already-verified session
└───────────────────────┘     from request context
```

Key points:

- **The JWT itself never has to be decoded by application code.** Clerk's middleware verifies the signature (against Clerk's rotating public keys) and expiry as part of `clerkMiddleware()`, before your route handler runs.
- Route handlers and Server Components call `auth()` (or `currentUser()`) from `@clerk/nextjs/server`, which reads the verified session that middleware already attached to the request — not the raw cookie.
- If verification fails (missing, expired, or tampered token), `auth()` simply returns `userId: null`. Whether that turns into a redirect or a 401 depends on the route (see below).

## 2. Middleware Routing (`src/middleware.ts`)

`src/middleware.ts` runs on **every matched request** (see the `matcher` config at the bottom of the file) before it reaches a page or API route. It does three things:

```ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  "/",
  "/sign-in(.*)",
  "/sign-up(.*)",
  "/api/webhook(.*)",
  "/privacy(.*)",
  "/terms(.*)",
]);

export default function middleware(request: any, event: any) {
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers);
  requestHeaders.set("x-pathname", request.nextUrl.pathname);

  return clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
    if (!isPublicRoute(req)) {
      await auth.protect();
    }
  })(request, event);
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon\\.ico|.*\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|svg|ico|woff2?|ttf|otf|eot|css|js|json|txt|xml|webmanifest)|manifest\\.json|sw\\.js|service-worker\\.js|robots\\.txt).*)",
    "/(api|trpc)(.*)",
  ],
};
```

**Step by step:**

1. **`createRouteMatcher`** defines an allowlist of public routes — the landing page, sign-in/sign-up pages, the Clerk webhook endpoint, and static legal pages. Everything not on this list is treated as protected.
2. **`clerkMiddleware(...)`** wraps the request. Inside the callback, `auth.protect()` is called for any route that _isn't_ public. `auth.protect()` is what actually triggers JWT verification — if the session is missing or invalid, it short-circuits the request (redirecting to sign-in for pages, or returning a 401 for API routes) before your handler code ever runs.
3. **The `matcher` export** controls which requests Next.js even routes through this middleware. It deliberately excludes static assets (images, fonts, the service worker, `manifest.json`) so those aren't needlessly gated behind auth, but explicitly _includes_ everything under `/api` and `/trpc`.
4. A custom `x-pathname` header is attached to the forwarded request, which app code uses to know the current route without re-parsing the URL.

**Net effect:** by the time a request reaches an API route handler or Server Component, one of two things is already true — it hit a public route with no auth check, or `auth.protect()` already confirmed there's a valid, verified session.

## 3. Decoding Secrets: How Routes Verify Sessions

WorkSphere never manually decodes or verifies the Clerk JWT signature in application code — that's handled entirely by the Clerk SDK using the keys below. There are two distinct verification paths in the app:

### a) Session verification for signed-in users

Every protected API route (favorites, venue ratings, conversations, etc.) calls `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`, which reads the session already validated by `clerkMiddleware()`:

```ts
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export async function GET() {
  const { userId } = await auth();

  if (!userId) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // proceed knowing userId is a verified Clerk user id
}
```

This relies on two env vars configured in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...   # public, safe for the browser
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...                    # server-only, used to talk to Clerk's API
```

The secret key is used by the Clerk SDK server-side to fetch signing keys and validate the JWT's signature and claims (issuer, expiry, audience). Application code never touches the raw token or the secret directly — `auth()` and `currentUser()` are the only interfaces.

For routes that also need full profile data (name, email, avatar) rather than just the id, `src/lib/auth.ts` exposes a helper that calls `currentUser()` and lazily syncs the user into the local database if a webhook hasn't created it yet:

```ts
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export async function ensureUserExists(userId: string) {
  const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  if (existingUser) return existingUser;

  const user = await currentUser();
  if (!user || user.id !== userId) return null;

  return prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.emailAddresses[0]?.emailAddress,
      firstName: user.firstName,
      lastName: user.lastName,
      imageUrl: user.imageUrl,
    },
  });
}
```

### b) Signature verification for the Clerk webhook

The one route explicitly excluded from `auth.protect()` — `/api/webhook` — receives events directly from Clerk's servers, not from a signed-in browser. It has no session cookie to check. Instead it verifies a **Svix HMAC signature** using a separate secret (`WEBHOOK_SECRET`, from the Clerk Dashboard's webhook configuration):

```ts
import { Webhook } from "svix";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

const wh = new Webhook(process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!);

const svix_id = headerPayload.get("svix-id");
const svix_timestamp = headerPayload.get("svix-timestamp");
const svix_signature = headerPayload.get("svix-signature");

const evt = wh.verify(body, {
  "svix-id": svix_id,
  "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
  "svix-signature": svix_signature,
}) as WebhookEvent;
```

If verification fails, the route returns a `400` and does not process the payload. On a verified `user.created` event, it creates the corresponding row in the local `User` table — this is the primary path that keeps Postgres in sync with Clerk; `ensureUserExists` above is only a fallback for when this webhook hasn't fired yet.

| Clerk → Webhook route | Svix HMAC signature on the raw payload, unrelated to session JWTs | `WEBHOOK_SECRET`                                |
